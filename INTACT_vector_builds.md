I'm having second thoughts about using GFP for the pull-down - I'm going to hedge my bets by adding the 23 \
amino acid BLRP ubi-ligase target sequence to the N-term of GFP

Some info about BLRP: \
Tag:BLRP is an artificial 23 amino acid residue peptide (MASSLRQILDSQKMEWRSNAGGS) that can be biotinylated \
efficiently in vivo by the Ecol\birA biotin ligase (biotinylation occurs on the K residue of the tag). \
The biotinylated tag can then be used as an affinity tag for one-step purification, by binding to streptavidin, \
of the tagged protein or its complexes (PMID:12802011).

I will have this sequence synthesized with overhangs for dropping in front of GFP
