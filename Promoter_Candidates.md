## Biotroph/SA reporter construct

In my initial drafts of this proposal I suggest using Setaria PR1 gene promoters as biotrophic stress reporters - I still want to \
do this, but defining these promoters is a little tricky.

Bestuyaku et al 2018 created some really cool SA and JA reporter Arabidopsis lines, but they used a 4.5kb PR1 promoter... this is \
longer than I was hoping to use

A recent Brachypodium paper from Shimizu et al 2022 used a smaller fragment to make a luciferase reporter - 1.5â€‰kb upstream from the \
start codon of BdPR1 (Bradi1g57580) (PR1P) was cloned and inserted in front of the Fluc reporter gene::NOST cassette

## TALE reporter construct

Because I'm working with Xanthomonas I have a shot at using a TALE inducible promoter --
