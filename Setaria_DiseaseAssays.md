## Prior to fully implementing the INTACT system in S. viridis, I need to confirm that I have a pathogen that causes symptoms.

## Xtu

A study of Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa from wheat fields in Minnesota showed that several weedy species can act as reservoirs for Xtu. \
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33225830/ \
It is not immediately clear if carrying/being infected by Xtu causes visible symptoms in these species - but after isolation they do cause symptoms on wheat

This table is from Kristi Ledman and summarizes Xanthomonas strains isolated from Sv and othe Setaria species

Inoculation protocol and Wilbrink's protocol provided by Rebecca Curland (link to these)

Modification to protocol:\
I am using 4 inch pots with 3 plants/pot and omitting fertilizer (I'll add this back if it seems necessary) \
The growth conditions in our growth chamber are slightly different - 16 hour days 30c, 8 hour nights 20c \
Inoculations are happening in the Springer Lab growth chambers.

### RESULT - I got very nice water-soaking on wheat, so I know my conditions are suitable for disease, however I did not get water-soaking on Setaria.  I did get some necrotic spots near the infiltration site that did not appear in the buffer only control, but I do not think this is a system that I will continue with

## Xvv

Xanthomonas vasicola pv vasculorum causes bacterial leaf streak of corn - it is not a vascular pathogen (at least not in maize) and there is literature that says it causes symptoms on Setaria viridis \
https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO-04-19-0132-R \
Note that inoculum was sprayed onto plants in this study

I have received a Minnesota isolate from Rebecca Curland (she received it from the Malvick lab) -- I am starting to add a popcorn variety to the weekly S viridis plantings to have a proper postive control and looking forward to assaying this isolate on Sv

Inoculation - After speaking with Jillian Lang from CSU, I will be attempting my first inoculation via syringe infiltration. She mentioned that maize is VERY easy to inoculate and it is important to mark the edges of the inoculation site.
She used maize cultivar DKC 61-88 and grew inoculum on PSA plates and suspended to 10^8 CFU/ml - measured symptoms at 7dpi
