## Prior to fully implementing the INTACT system in S. viridis, I need to confirm that I have a pathogen that causes symptoms.

A study of Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa from wheat fields in Minnesota showed that several weedy species can act as reservoirs for Xtu. \
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33225830/ \
It is not immediately clear if carrying/being infected by Xtu causes visible symptoms in these species - but after isolation they do cause symptoms on wheat

This table is from Kristi Ledman and summarizes Xanthomonas strains isolated from Sv and othe Setaria species

Inoculation protocol and Wilbrink's protocol provided by Rebecca Curland (link to these)

Modification to protocol:\
I am using 4 inch pots with 3 plants/pot and omitting fertilizer (I'll add this back if it seems necessary) \
The growth conditions in our growth chamber are slightly different - 16 hour days 30c, 8 hour nights 20c \
Inoculations are happening in the Springer Lab growth chambers.
